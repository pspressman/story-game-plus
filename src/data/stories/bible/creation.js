      text: "In the beginning, there was nothing but darkness. Then God spoke, 'Let there be light!' And suddenly light appeared, pushing away the darkness. God called the light 'day' and the darkness 'night.' This was the first day of creation. On the second day, God made the sky, separating the waters above from the waters below."

      question: "When you imagine the moment light first appears, what do you see in your mind?",
      options: [
        "Light slowly growing like a sunrise over the earth",
        "A sudden bright flash that immediately fills everything",
        "Small dots of light appearing one by one like stars",
        "A rainbow of colors swirling together to make light"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The story describes God speaking 'Let there be light!' and then light suddenly appearing. Visualizing a dramatic, immediate appearance of light helps capture the powerful moment of creation described in Genesis."

      type: "story",
      text: "On the third day, God gathered the waters together to create seas, and dry land appeared. God commanded plants and trees to grow from the earth. Beautiful flowers, tall trees, and green grass covered the land. On the fourth day, God placed the sun, moon, and stars in the sky to mark seasons, days, and years."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "movement",
      question: "In your mind, how do the plants appear when God creates them?",
      options: [
        "Fully grown plants suddenly pop up from the ground",
        "Tiny seeds fall from the sky and quickly grow into plants",
        "Small sprouts emerge and rapidly grow upward, unfurling leaves and branches",
        "Plants appear as colorful paint spreading across the ground"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Visualizing plants emerging and growing rapidly helps create a dynamic mental picture of creation. Seeing the process of growth—even if accelerated—helps understand how God's command brought forth living things from the earth."

      type: "story",
      text: "On the fifth day, God filled the oceans with fish and the skies with birds. Huge whales swam in the deep waters, while eagles and sparrows soared through the air. On the sixth day, God created all the animals that live on land—from tiny insects to enormous elephants. Finally, God created humans in His own image. God looked at everything He had made and saw that it was very good."

      type: "question",
      domain: "what",
      question: "When you picture the animals being created, what do you see?",
      options: [
        "Animals appearing one at a time, each completely different from the last",
        "All animals appearing at once in a big crowd",
        "Animals forming from the dust of the ground, taking shape as they rise up",
        "Animals emerging from the ocean fully formed"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Imagining animals forming from the dust of the ground connects with how Genesis describes creation and later specifically mentions Adam being formed from dust. This mental picture shows the connection between the animals and the earth they would live on."

    {
      type: "story",
      text: "On the seventh day, God rested from all the work of creation. He blessed this day and made it holy, setting it apart as a special day of rest. God had created everything—the light and darkness, the oceans and land, all plants and trees, the sun, moon and stars, all birds and fish, every animal, and people. The world was full of wonderful things that showed God's power and creativity."

      domain: "environment",
      question: "How do you picture the world at the end of creation?",
      options: [
        "Dark and still, with everything sleeping",
        "Bright, colorful, and full of life with animals, plants, and people",
        "Empty except for a few trees and animals",
        "Covered in tall buildings and cities"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Genesis tells us God saw everything He made and it was 'very good.' Visualizing a vibrant, thriving world full of diverse plants, animals, and people helps us understand the beauty and completeness of creation."

    {
      type: "story",
      text: "God placed the first humans, Adam and Eve, in a beautiful garden called Eden. They were given the job of taking care of all the plants and animals. God told them they could eat fruit from any tree in the garden except one—the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. 'If you eat from that tree,' God warned, 'you will die.' Everything in the garden was peaceful and perfect.",
      moral: "God created everything with care and purpose, showing His love and creativity in the world around us."
