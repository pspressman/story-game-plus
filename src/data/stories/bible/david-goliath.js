    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Long ago, there was a conflict between the Philistines and the Israelites. The Philistine army had a mighty warrior named Goliath who was over nine feet tall. Every day, Goliath would challenge the Israelites to send out a champion to face him in one-on-one combat."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "size",
      question: "How tall would Goliath appear compared to an ordinary man?",
      options: [
        "Just slightly taller, about a head higher",
        "About twice as tall as an ordinary man",
        "Nearly three times the height of an ordinary man",
        "So tall his head would touch the clouds"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "At over nine feet tall, Goliath would most logically appear about twice the height of an ordinary man from that time period (who would have been around 5-5.5 feet tall), not just slightly taller or impossibly huge."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "No Israelite soldier was brave enough to face the giant. Then came a young shepherd boy named David, who had been sent by his father to bring food to his older brothers in the army. David heard Goliath's challenges and was surprised that no one would fight him."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "what",
      question: "What would David most likely be carrying when he arrived at the Israelite camp?",
      options: [
        "A modern backpack with zippers",
        "A bundle wrapped in cloth and a shepherd's staff",
        "A plastic container with food",
        "Nothing at all"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "As a shepherd boy in ancient times bringing supplies, David would most logically be visualized carrying a bundle of food wrapped in cloth and his shepherd's staff, not modern items like backpacks or plastic containers."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "David went to King Saul and offered to fight Goliath. At first, the king refused because David was just a boy. But David explained how he had protected his sheep from lions and bears, and that with God's help, he could defeat the giant."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "King Saul finally agreed and offered David his armor. But the armor was too big and heavy for David. Instead, David chose to go with just his sling and five smooth stones that he picked from a nearby stream."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "shape",
      question: "What shape would David's sling most likely be?",
      options: [
        "A straight stick with a cup at the end",
        "A Y-shaped stick with a leather pocket",
        "A leather strap with a pouch in the middle",
        "A rectangular wooden box with a spring"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "A traditional shepherd's sling from that time period would be visualized as a leather strap with a pouch in the middle for holding stones, not a stick, Y-shaped object, or wooden box."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "When Goliath saw the young David approaching with just a staff and sling, he was insulted. \"Am I a dog that you come at me with sticks?\" he roared. Goliath cursed David and threatened to feed his body to the birds."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "perspective",
      question: "From what angle would David most likely view Goliath?",
      options: [
        "Looking down at Goliath from above",
        "Looking straight at Goliath at eye level",
        "Looking up at Goliath from below",
        "Looking at Goliath from behind"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Since Goliath was described as over nine feet tall and David was a young boy, David would naturally be looking up at Goliath from below, not at eye level, from above, or from behind."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "David replied, \"You come against me with sword and spear, but I come against you in the name of the Lord. Today the Lord will deliver you into my hands.\" David ran toward Goliath, took out a stone, placed it in his sling, and slung it with all his might."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "The stone struck Goliath in the forehead, and he fell face down on the ground. Using Goliath's own sword, David then made sure the giant would not rise again. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled in fear, and the Israelites were victorious."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "movement",
      question: "How would the Philistine army most likely be moving as they fled?",
      options: [
        "Walking slowly and calmly away",
        "Running in a organized military formation",
        "Running chaotically in different directions",
        "Standing still in shock"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "When seeing their champion defeated unexpectedly, the Philistine army would most naturally be visualized as fleeing in chaos and fear, running in different directions rather than in orderly formation or calmly walking away."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      moral: "Courage, faith, and resourcefulness can overcome seemingly impossible odds. True strength comes not from physical size but from inner conviction."
