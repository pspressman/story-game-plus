      text: "Jacob had twelve sons, but he loved Joseph the most. He gave Joseph a special colorful coat, which made Joseph's brothers jealous.

      ],

      options: [
        "Smiling and congratulating Joseph on his interesting dream",
        "Looking confused because they don't understand what the dream means",
        "Frowning with narrowed eyes and clenched jaws, showing anger and jealousy",
        "Laughing loudly and slapping their knees, thinking it's a great joke"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The story tells us the brothers were jealous and angry about Joseph's dream. Visualizing their hostile expressions helps create a mental picture of the growing tension between Joseph and his brothers."

    {
      type: "story",
      text: "One day, Jacob sent Joseph to check on his brothers who were watching the sheep far from home. When the brothers saw Joseph coming, they made a terrible plan. 'Here comes the dreamer!' they said. They grabbed Joseph, took away his colorful coat, and threw him into a deep, dry well. Later, they saw some merchants traveling to Egypt and sold Joseph to them as a slave."

      domain: "environment",
      question: "How do you picture the well that Joseph was thrown into?",
      options: [
        "A shallow puddle of water with frogs hopping around",
        "A deep pit with high stone walls and no water at the bottom",
        "A modern well with a bucket on a rope and handle to turn",
        "A small hole just big enough for a mouse"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The story describes a 'deep, dry well.' Visualizing a pit with high stone walls creates an accurate mental picture of the kind of ancient well that would be impossible for Joseph to climb out of without help."

      type: "question",
      domain: "perspective",
      question: "When you imagine Joseph in the well looking up, what would he see?",
      options: [
        "A perfect square of blue sky directly above him",
        "A small circle of light above with the shadows of his brothers' faces peering down",
        "Complete darkness with no light at all",
        "Stars and the moon because it was nighttime"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "From the bottom of a deep well, Joseph would see a circle of light above, and likely his brothers looking down at him. Visualizing this perspective helps create a mental picture of Joseph's frightening situation."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "The brothers took Joseph's coat, tore it, and dipped it in goat's blood. They showed it to their father Jacob and said, 'We found this. Is it Joseph's coat?' Jacob recognized it and thought a wild animal had killed Joseph. He was heartbroken and cried for many days. Meanwhile, Joseph was taken to Egypt and sold to a man named Potiphar, who was an official of the Pharaoh."

      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The story says Jacob was 'heartbroken and cried for many days.' Visualizing physical signs of extreme grief creates an emotional mental picture that matches how devastating this news would be for a father."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "In Egypt, Joseph worked hard and was honest. God was with Joseph, and he did well at everything he tried. Soon Potiphar put Joseph in charge of his entire household. But Potiphar's wife told lies about Joseph, and he was unfairly thrown into prison. Even in prison, Joseph remained faithful to God. The prison warden saw that Joseph was trustworthy and put him in charge of the other prisoners."

      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The story says Joseph 'worked hard and was honest' and 'did well at everything he tried.' Visualizing him as diligent and organized helps create a mental picture that explains why Potiphar would put him in charge of his household."

    {
      type: "story",
      text: "While in prison, Joseph met Pharaoh's cupbearer and baker, who both had strange dreams. God helped Joseph understand what the dreams meant. Joseph's interpretations came true exactly as he said. Two years later, Pharaoh himself had troubling dreams that no one could explain. The cupbearer remembered Joseph and told Pharaoh, 'I know someone who can interpret dreams!'"

        "Sleeping peacefully with a small smile",
        "Tossing and turning, with a worried expression, perhaps waking suddenly",
        "Working on his throne, not sleeping at all",
        "Floating above his bed while sleeping"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Since the dreams are described as 'troubling,' visualizing physical signs of distress during sleep creates a realistic mental picture of how disturbing dreams would affect someone."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Joseph was brought from prison to Pharaoh. After hearing the dreams, Joseph said, 'God is showing you what He is about to do. There will be seven years with plenty of food, followed by seven years of severe famine. You should store food during the good years to prepare for the bad years.' Pharaoh was so impressed with Joseph's wisdom that he put him in charge of all Egypt, second only to Pharaoh himself."

      type: "question",
      domain: "what",
      question: "In your mind, what changes for Joseph after Pharaoh puts him in charge?",
      options: [
        "Nothing changes; he continues wearing prison clothes and living in his cell",
        "He is given royal clothes, a special ring, a gold chain, and rides in a chariot",
        "He runs away from Egypt back to his father's land immediately",
        "He becomes mean and punishes everyone who was ever unkind to him"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "In the Genesis story, Joseph receives symbols of authority including special clothes, jewelry, and transportation. Visualizing these outward signs of his new position helps create a mental picture of his dramatic change in status."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Joseph's plan worked perfectly. During the seven good years, he collected and stored enormous amounts of grain. When the famine came, Egypt had enough food, while surrounding countries had none. People from many lands came to Egypt to buy food, including Joseph's brothers. They didn't recognize Joseph, who now looked like an Egyptian ruler, but he recognized them."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "environment",
      question: "When you imagine the storehouses in Egypt during the famine, what do you see?",
      options: [
        "Empty buildings with no food left",
        "Small baskets with just a handful of grain in each",
        "Massive buildings filled with grain while people line up outside to buy food",
        "Buildings full of fruits and vegetables but no grain"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The story mentions Joseph stored 'enormous amounts of grain' that was sufficient during the seven-year famine. Visualizing large storehouses with plenty of grain and people coming to buy food creates an accurate mental picture of this situation."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "what",
      question: "How do you picture Joseph now, compared to when his brothers last saw him?",
      options: [
        "Exactly the same, wearing his torn colorful coat",
        "Much taller and with wings like an angel",
        "Dressed as an Egyptian official with different hairstyle, makeup, and royal clothing",
        "Invisible so no one can see him at all"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Joseph had been in Egypt for many years and was now dressed as an Egyptian ruler. Visualizing his transformed appearance helps understand why his brothers wouldn't recognize him, even though he recognized them."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "After testing his brothers to see if they had changed, Joseph finally revealed himself to them. 'I am Joseph, your brother!' he said. His brothers were shocked and afraid. But Joseph told them, 'Don't be afraid. What you meant for harm, God used for good to save many lives during this famine.' Joseph forgave his brothers and invited his entire family to come live in Egypt where they would have plenty of food.",
      moral: "God can bring good from difficult situations, and forgiveness is more powerful than holding onto anger or seeking revenge."
