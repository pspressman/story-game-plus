      type: "story",
      text: "The descendants of Jacob, called Israelites, moved to Egypt during a famine. At first, they were welcomed because Jacob's son Joseph was an important leader there. But many years later, a new Pharaoh who didn't know about Joseph became ruler of Egypt. He saw that the Israelites had grown into a large group and was afraid they might become too powerful. So he made them slaves and forced them to work very hard building cities."

      question: "In your mind, what do you see when you imagine the Israelites working as slaves in Egypt?",
      options: [
        "People relaxing under palm trees and occasionally picking up a brick",
        "Smiling workers happily building small sandcastles on a beach",
        "People straining to carry heavy loads in the hot sun, with Egyptian overseers watching them",
        "Children playing games while adults watch from comfortable chairs"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Exodus describes the slavery as 'bitter' with 'harsh labor' making bricks and working in fields. Visualizing people struggling under heavy burdens in hot conditions creates an accurate mental picture of the suffering the Israelites experienced."

      type: "question",
      domain: "what",
      question: "How do you picture the Egyptian cities that the Israelites were forced to build?",
      options: [
        "Small houses made of straw that could blow away easily",
        "Modern skyscrapers with glass windows and elevators",
        "Large structures made of stone blocks and mud bricks, with tall columns and statues",
        "Underground caves where people lived beneath the sand"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Ancient Egyptian cities included massive structures built with stone blocks and mud bricks. Visualizing large buildings with columns and statues helps create an accurate mental picture of the construction projects the Israelites were forced to work on."

    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Pharaoh became so worried about the growing number of Israelites that he gave a terrible orderâ€”all Israelite baby boys should be thrown into the Nile River. During this dangerous time, a woman named Jochebed had a baby boy. For three months, she kept him hidden. When she couldn't hide him any longer, she made a waterproof basket and placed him among the reeds along the riverbank. The baby's sister, Miriam, watched from a distance to see what would happen."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "what",
      question: "How do you picture the basket Jochebed made for her baby?",
      options: [
        "A modern plastic laundry basket with holes all over it",
        "A tiny basket that could only fit a doll",
        "A carefully woven basket covered with tar and pitch to make it waterproof, lined with soft cloth",
        "A large wooden boat with sails and oars"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Exodus describes a 'papyrus basket' coated with tar and pitch to make it waterproof. Visualizing a carefully crafted container designed both for safety and comfort helps create a mental picture of a mother's loving protection in desperate circumstances."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "perspective",
      question: "When you imagine Miriam watching her baby brother in the basket, what do you see from her point of view?",
      options: [
        "Standing in plain sight on the riverbank right next to the basket",
        "Hiding among tall reeds, peeking out carefully to see the basket bobbing in the water",
        "Flying high above like a bird, seeing everything from the sky",
        "Sitting at home far away, not actually watching at all"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The story says Miriam 'watched from a distance.' Visualizing her hiding among reeds while still being able to see what happens to her brother creates a realistic mental picture of how a child might hide while keeping watch."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Pharaoh's daughter came to the river to bathe and saw the basket among the reeds. When she opened it, she found a crying baby boy. She felt sorry for him and said, 'This is one of the Hebrew babies.' Miriam approached and offered to find a Hebrew woman to nurse the baby. She ran to get her mother, Jochebed. Pharaoh's daughter said, 'Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.' She named him Moses, which means 'drawn out of the water.'"
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "expression",
      question: "When you imagine Pharaoh's daughter finding the basket, what expression do you see on her face?",
      options: [
        "Angry and annoyed at finding a baby",
        "Frightened and running away immediately",
        "Surprised at first, then softening with compassion when she sees the crying baby",
        "Bored and uninterested in what she found"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Exodus tells us she 'felt sorry for him' despite knowing he was a Hebrew baby who should have been killed. Visualizing her expression changing from surprise to compassion creates a mental picture of the pivotal moment when Moses' life was spared."

    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Moses grew up in Pharaoh's palace as a prince of Egypt. But he knew he was really an Israelite. One day, when he was grown, Moses saw an Egyptian beating an Israelite slave. Thinking no one was watching, Moses killed the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand. But someone had seen what happened. When Pharaoh heard about it, he tried to kill Moses, who fled to a far country called Midian."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "movement",
      question: "In your mind, how does Moses travel as he flees from Egypt to Midian?",
      options: [
        "In a luxurious chariot with servants attending him",
        "On foot, traveling quickly through the desert, perhaps looking over his shoulder",
        "Swimming across the sea in scuba diving gear",
        "Being carried by a giant eagle flying through the sky"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Moses was fleeing for his life after losing his position in the palace. Visualizing him traveling urgently on foot through harsh terrain creates a realistic mental picture of his desperate journey away from Pharaoh's reach."

    {
      type: "story",
      text: "In Midian, Moses helped some young women water their sheep when other shepherds tried to chase them away. Their father, Jethro, invited Moses to stay with them. Moses married one of Jethro's daughters and became a shepherd. For forty years, Moses lived quietly in Midian, far from the palaces of Egypt. But God had not forgotten the suffering of the Israelites in Egypt, and He had a special plan for Moses."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "what",
      question: "How do you picture Moses after his years as a shepherd in Midian?",
      options: [
        "Still dressed in fancy Egyptian clothes with perfect hair",
        "Looking exactly like he did as a young man with no changes",
        "Weathered by the sun, with simpler clothes, a beard, and perhaps a shepherd's staff",
        "Wearing a superhero cape and mask"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "After forty years as a shepherd in the wilderness, Moses would look very different from the Egyptian prince he once was. Visualizing him with the appearance of a desert shepherd helps create a mental picture of how his life had completely changed."

    {
      type: "story",
      text: "One day, while tending his sheep near a mountain called Horeb, Moses saw something amazingâ€”a bush that was on fire but wasn't burning up! As he went closer to look, God called to him from the bush, 'Moses, Moses!' God told Moses that He had seen the suffering of the Israelites and had come to rescue them. 'I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people out of Egypt,' God said. Moses was afraid and made excuses, but God promised to be with him."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "what",
      question: "When you imagine the burning bush, what do you see?",
      options: [
        "A small, barely visible flame on one leaf",
        "A normal fire gradually consuming the bush and turning it to ash",
        "Bright flames covering the entire bush without consuming it, perhaps with an unusual color or glow",
        "Fireworks shooting out from behind a normal-looking bush"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Exodus describes 'flames of fire' coming from the middle of the bush, yet 'the bush was not consumed.' Visualizing bright, supernatural fire that doesn't destroy the bush creates a mental picture of this miraculous sign that caught Moses' attention."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "expression",
      question: "How do you picture Moses' face when God speaks to him from the burning bush?",
      options: [
        "Smiling and completely relaxed, as if this happens every day",
        "Shocked and afraid, perhaps shielding his eyes and stepping back",
        "Angry and stomping away, not wanting to listen",
        "Sleeping peacefully, dreaming the whole thing"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "When God speaks from a burning bushâ€”something completely unexpected and supernaturalâ€”visualizing Moses as shocked and afraid helps create a realistic mental picture of how someone would react to such an extraordinary event."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Moses returned to Egypt with his brother Aaron and told Pharaoh, 'God says: Let my people go!' But Pharaoh refused. God sent ten terrible plagues on Egyptâ€”water turning to blood, frogs, gnats, flies, livestock dying, boils, hail, locusts, darkness, and finally, the death of the firstborn sons. After the last plague, Pharaoh finally allowed the Israelites to leave. Moses led them through the Red Sea, which God miraculously parted, and into the wilderness toward the Promised Land."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "environment",
      question: "When you picture the parting of the Red Sea, what do you see?",
      options: [
        "A tiny stream that people could easily step across",
        "Two walls of water standing up on either side, creating a dry path through the middle",
        "People swimming across the sea with no miracle happening",
        "A bridge made of rocks appearing above the water"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Exodus describes the sea divided with water forming walls on both sides and dry ground in the middle. Visualizing two towering walls of water with a path between them creates a mental picture that captures the miraculous nature of this famous biblical event."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "The Israelites were finally free! They traveled through the wilderness where God provided food called manna that appeared on the ground each morning. Moses received the Ten Commandments from God on Mount Sinai and led the people for forty years. Although Moses himself didn't enter the Promised Land, he brought the Israelites to its border. Through Moses, God had rescued His people just as He had promised.",
      moral: "God hears the cries of those who suffer and works in unexpected ways to rescue them. Even when we feel inadequate, God can use us to do amazing things if we trust Him."
