    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Many years ago, the people on Earth had become very wicked. God was saddened by their actions and decided to send a great flood to cleanse the Earth. But there was one man named Noah who was good and faithful. God told Noah to build a large boat called an ark because He was going to send a flood that would cover the entire Earth."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "what",
      question: "What tools would Noah most likely use to build the ark?",
      options: [
        "Modern power tools like electric saws and drills",
        "Simple hand tools like wooden hammers, axes, and hand saws",
        "Magical tools that worked by themselves",
        "No tools at all, just his hands"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Since the story takes place in ancient times, Noah would have used simple hand tools like wooden hammers, axes, and hand saws that were available in that era, not modern power tools or magical options."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "God gave Noah specific instructions on how to build the ark. It was to be made of gopher wood and covered with pitch inside and out. The ark would be 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high, with three decks and a door in the side."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "shape",
      question: "What shape would the ark most likely be?",
      options: [
        "A perfect cube with flat sides",
        "Round like a modern cruise ship",
        "A long rectangular box with a roof",
        "A sleek narrow triangle like a speedboat"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Based on the biblical description of the ark's dimensions (length, width, and height), it would most logically be visualized as a long rectangular box with a roof, not a cube, modern ship shape, or speedboat design."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "God told Noah to bring two of every kind of animal onto the ark, male and female, to keep them alive during the flood. He was also to take seven pairs of every kind of clean animal and bird. Noah was to bring enough food for his family and all the animals."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "number",
      question: "How many windows would you visualize on the ark?",
      options: [
        "No windows at all",
        "One window at the top",
        "Many small windows along the sides",
        "Large glass windows throughout"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "According to the biblical account, there was one window at the top of the ark, not multiple windows or modern glass designs, which would not have been available in ancient times."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "It took Noah many years to build the ark. People laughed at him for building such a large boat on dry land, but Noah continued to work faithfully. When the ark was finished, Noah brought his family and all the animals inside, just as God had instructed."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "sound",
      question: "What sounds would you hear inside the ark during the flood?",
      options: [
        "Complete silence with no sounds at all",
        "Only the sound of rain on the roof",
        "Animal noises, creaking wood, and rain hitting the ark",
        "Modern engine sounds and music"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Inside the ark during the flood, you would logically hear a combination of animal noises, the creaking of the wooden structure, and the sound of rain and water hitting the exterior of the ark."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Then it began to rain. It rained for forty days and forty nights without stopping. The waters rose higher and higher until all the land was covered, even the highest mountains. Everything on dry land that had the breath of life died. Only Noah and those with him in the ark remained alive."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "color",
      question: "What color would the sky appear during most of the flood?",
      options: [
        "Bright blue with occasional clouds",
        "Dark gray with heavy storm clouds",
        "Pure white from thick cloud cover",
        "Red and orange like a sunset"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "During a prolonged, catastrophic rainstorm that lasted for 40 days, the sky would logically appear dark gray with heavy storm clouds, not clear blue, pure white, or sunset colors."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "After 150 days, the waters began to recede. The ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. Noah sent out a raven and then a dove to see if the waters had dried up from the Earth. When the dove returned with a fresh olive leaf, Noah knew the waters had receded."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "where",
      question: "Where would the olive tree the dove found most likely be located?",
      options: [
        "On top of the highest mountain peak",
        "On a lower hillside emerging from the water",
        "Floating on the water's surface",
        "Inside the ark in a pot"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "For the dove to find a fresh olive leaf, the tree would most logically be on a lower hillside or area that had recently emerged from the receding floodwaters, not on the highest peak, floating, or inside the ark."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "God told Noah to leave the ark with his family and all the animals. Noah built an altar and made an offering to thank God. God placed a rainbow in the sky as a sign of His promise never to flood the entire Earth again."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "perspective",
      question: "From what angle would you see the rainbow after the flood?",
      options: [
        "Directly above the ark like a ceiling",
        "In the distance, arching across the sky",
        "Under the water's surface",
        "Inside the ark through the window"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "A rainbow would naturally appear in the distance, arching across the sky as the sun's light passes through remaining water droplets in the air, not directly overhead, underwater, or visible only through the ark's window."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      moral: "Faith and obedience can carry us through even the most difficult challenges, and after every storm, there is hope."
