      question: "When you picture the hole in Maya's backpack before Grandma fixes it, how big would it be compared to a coin?",
      options: [
        "As big as a dinner plate",
        "Smaller than a penny",
        "The size of a basketball",
        "Bigger than Maya's hand"

      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The hole is tiny - that's why it only needs one stitch to fix it right now."

      type: "question",
      domain: "movement",
      question: "Picture what happens to a small hole in a backpack when Maya puts heavy books in it every day. How would the hole change?",
      options: [
        "It would stay exactly the same size",
        "It would slowly get smaller",
        "It would stretch and tear bigger",
        "It would move to a different spot"

      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Just like in your mental picture, small problems grow bigger when we don't fix them!"

      type: "story",
      text: "Maya thought about other 'small holes' in her life. She had one math problem she didn't understand. If she asked for help now, it would be like one stitch. But if she waited..."

      domain: "number",
      question: "Visualize Maya's math homework over many days. If she doesn't understand one concept today and doesn't ask for help, how many problems might confuse her by next week?",
      options: [
        "Still just one problem",
        "Many problems that build on that concept",
        "No problems at all",
        "Problems in other subjects only"

      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "When we don't fix one small problem, it can cause many bigger problems later - just like the hole!"
    },

      question: "Picture this: Tom notices his bike chain is a little loose. Using what you learned from Maya's story, what should Tom visualize happening if he doesn't fix it soon?",
      options: [
        "The chain staying slightly loose forever",
        "The chain fixing itself over time",
        "The chain getting looser until it falls off",
        "The chain turning a different color"
