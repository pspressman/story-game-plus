      text: "Isaac, the son of Abraham, had twin sons named Esau and Jacob. Esau was born first, making him the older brother. He grew up to be a skilled hunter who loved the outdoors. Jacob was quieter and preferred staying among the tents. Isaac favored Esau, but their mother Rebekah favored Jacob. One day, Jacob tricked his father into giving him the special blessing that should have gone to Esau, the firstborn son."

      domain: "what",
      question: "In your mind, how do you picture Esau and Jacob looking different from each other?",
      options: [
        "They look exactly the same with no differences at all",
        "Esau is small and thin while Jacob is very tall and strong",
        "Esau has red hair and is hairy, while Jacob has smoother skin and is less rugged",
        "Jacob has bright blue hair while Esau has green hair"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Genesis describes Esau as red and hairy, while Jacob had smoother skin. Visualizing these physical differences helps create distinct mental pictures of the two brothers and their contrasting natures."

      type: "story",
      text: "When Esau discovered what had happened, he was furious and threatened to kill Jacob. Rebekah warned Jacob about Esau's anger and told him to flee to her brother Laban's house far away. As Jacob journeyed alone, night fell, and he had to sleep outdoors. He found a stone to use as a pillow and lay down to sleep under the stars."

      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,

    {
      type: "story",
      text: "While Jacob slept, he had an amazing dream. He saw a stairway or ladder that reached from earth all the way up to heaven. Angels were going up and down the ladder. At the top stood God, who said, 'I am the LORD, the God of Abraham and Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying. Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and through your family, all peoples on earth will be blessed.'"

        "A moving escalator like in a department store"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The biblical description suggests a grand, impressive connection between heaven and earth. Visualizing a stairway of light with angels traveling up and down creates a mental picture that captures the supernatural, magnificent nature of this divine vision."

      ],

    {
      type: "story",
      text: "God also promised Jacob, 'I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go. I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.' When Jacob woke up, he was amazed. 'Surely the LORD is in this place, and I was not aware of it,' he said. 'This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven.'"

        "Wide-eyed with awe, perhaps touching his face to make sure he's awake",
        "Confused and unable to remember anything about the dream"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Jacob's words express awe and revelationâ€”realizing he had encountered God unexpectedly. Visualizing his face showing wonder and amazement creates a mental picture that matches his exclamation about being in 'the house of God.'"
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Jacob took the stone he had used as a pillow and set it up as a pillar. He poured oil on top of it to mark it as a special place. He named that place Bethel, which means 'house of God.' Then Jacob made a promise to God: 'If God will be with me and watch over me, and if I return safely to my father's household, then the LORD will be my God.'"

      options: [

        "A large modern building made of concrete blocks"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Genesis describes Jacob setting up his stone pillow as a pillar and pouring oil on top. Visualizing this simple yet meaningful monument helps create a mental picture of how Jacob marked this holy place of encounter with God."

      options: [
        "Quickly dumping the entire container with no care",
        "Using an eyedropper to place one drop precisely in the center",
        "Carefully tilting the container to let the oil flow slowly over the top of the stone",
        "Flicking droplets randomly in all directions"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Since this was a sacred moment marking a holy place, visualizing Jacob pouring the oil slowly and deliberately helps create a mental picture of the reverence and care he would have shown in this act of worship."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Jacob continued his journey to his uncle Laban's home, where he lived for many years. He married and had children, and his family grew. Eventually, God told Jacob it was time to return home. Jacob was afraid to face Esau, but when they finally met, Esau forgave him. Jacob, whose name was later changed to Israel, became the father of twelve sons who would become the twelve tribes of Israel. Through him, God's promise to Abraham continued.",
      moral: "God is with us even when we feel alone, and He can work through difficult situations to fulfill His greater purpose."
