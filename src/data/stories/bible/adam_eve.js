      text: "God placed Adam and Eve in the beautiful Garden of Eden. Fruit trees grew everywhere, and four rivers flowed through the garden. Adam's job was to take care of the garden and name all the animals. God told Adam and Eve they could eat fruit from any tree except one‚Äîthe tree of the knowledge of good and evil. 'If you eat from that tree,' God warned, 'you will die.'"

      type: "question",
      domain: "environment",
      question: "In your mind, what does the Garden of Eden look like?",
      options: [
        "A small patch of flowers and vegetables, like a backyard garden",
        "A vast park with perfectly arranged rows of identical trees",
        "A wild, lush paradise with diverse plants, flowers, and trees with rivers flowing through it",
        "A dark forest with tall trees blocking the sunlight"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Genesis describes Eden as having many fruit trees and being watered by four rivers. Visualizing a natural paradise with abundant variety helps create a mental picture of this perfect garden where the first humans lived."

    {
      type: "story",
      text: "One day, a crafty serpent approached Eve near the forbidden tree. 'Did God really say you can't eat from any tree in the garden?' the serpent asked. 'We can eat from any tree except this one,' Eve replied. 'God said we would die if we eat from it or even touch it.' The serpent said, 'You won't die! God knows that when you eat it, you'll become like Him, knowing good and evil.'"
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "perspective",
      question: "How do you picture the serpent talking to Eve?",
      options: [
        "Standing tall like a person with arms crossed",
        "Coiled around a branch of the tree, looking down at Eve",
        "Hiding behind a rock, only its voice heard",
        "Flying through the air with wings"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Visualizing the serpent in the tree helps create a mental picture connecting the tempter directly with the forbidden fruit. This position also suggests the serpent watching Eve from above, showing its cunning nature."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Eve looked at the fruit. It was beautiful and looked delicious. She thought about how wonderful it would be to become wise like God. She took a piece of the fruit and ate it. Then she gave some to Adam, who was with her, and he ate it too. Suddenly, their eyes were opened, and they realized they were naked. Feeling ashamed, they sewed fig leaves together to make coverings for themselves."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "expression",
      question: "When you imagine Adam and Eve realizing what they've done, what expressions do you see on their faces?",
      options: [
        "Big smiles, happily celebrating their new knowledge",
        "Confused expressions, not understanding what has changed",
        "Shocked and ashamed expressions, with eyes wide and perhaps hands covering their mouths",
        "Angry expressions, blaming each other immediately"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The story describes Adam and Eve feeling shame and trying to cover themselves, suggesting they experienced shock and dismay at their new awareness. Visualizing their expressions helps create an emotional connection to this pivotal moment."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Later that day, Adam and Eve heard God walking in the garden. Afraid, they hid among the trees. 'Where are you?' God called. Adam answered, 'I heard you, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.' God asked, 'Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree I commanded you not to eat from?' Adam blamed Eve, and Eve blamed the serpent."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "movement",
      question: "In your mind, how do Adam and Eve hide from God?",
      options: [
        "In a cave deep underground where they can't be found",
        "Behind bushes and trees, crouching down and trying to stay quiet",
        "By covering only their faces, thinking they can't be seen",
        "By climbing to the top of the tallest tree"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Genesis describes them hiding 'among the trees of the garden.' Visualizing them crouching behind vegetation, attempting to conceal themselves, creates a realistic mental picture of their fear and shame."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Because they disobeyed, God told Adam and Eve they would have to leave the beautiful garden. Life would become harder‚ÄîAdam would have to work the ground to grow food, and thorns and thistles would make his work difficult. Eve would have pain in childbirth. God made clothes from animal skins for Adam and Eve before sending them out of Eden. God placed angels with flaming swords at the entrance to the garden so the humans could not return."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "what",
      question: "How do you picture the angels guarding Eden's entrance?",
      options: [
        "Tiny fairies with small sparklers",
        "People in normal clothes standing at a gate",
        "Majestic beings with large, flaming swords that move in all directions",
        "Invisible forces that can only be heard, not seen"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Genesis describes 'cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way.' Visualizing impressive angelic beings with moving swords of fire creates a vivid mental picture of the powerful barrier preventing humans from returning to Eden."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Even though Adam and Eve had disobeyed, God still cared for them. He provided clothes to keep them warm and promised that someday, one of Eve's descendants would defeat the evil serpent. Adam and Eve began their new life outside the garden. Though life was harder, they still experienced God's love and provision. They had children, and from them came all the people who would ever live.",
      moral: "Our choices have consequences, but even when we make mistakes, God still loves us and promises to take care of us."
