      text: "Long ago, there lived a man named Abram in a city called Ur. One day, God spoke to Abram and said, 'Leave your country, your relatives, and your father's house, and go to the land I will show you. I will make you into a great nation. I will bless you and make you famous, and you will be a blessing to others.' Although Abram was already 75 years old, he obeyed God."

      question: "When you imagine Abram preparing for his journey, what do you see?",
      options: [
        "Abram traveling alone with just a small backpack",
        "Abram and his wife packing a few things in a modern suitcase",
        "Abram organizing tents, loading camels and donkeys with supplies, and gathering his household",
        "Abram building a boat to sail to the new land"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,

      text: "Abram took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and all their possessions and servants. They traveled many miles to a land called Canaan. When they arrived, God appeared to Abram and said, 'I will give this land to your descendants.' But there was one problem—Abram and Sarai had no children. Even though they were old, God promised that Abram would have as many descendants as the stars in the sky."

      type: "question",
      domain: "environment",
      question: "How do you picture the moment when God shows Abram the stars?",
      options: [
        "Stars appearing in daylight while the sun is still shining",
        "Abram in a tent looking at a map with stars drawn on it",
        "Abram standing outside at night, looking up as God directs his attention to the countless stars above",
        "Stars falling from the sky and landing in Abram's hands"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Genesis describes God taking Abram outside and telling him to look up at the stars. Visualizing Abram beneath a vast night sky creates a powerful mental picture of this important moment when God illustrated the greatness of his future descendants."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Years passed, and Abram and Sarai still had no children. Sarai suggested that Abram should have a child with her servant, Hagar. This happened, and Hagar had a son named Ishmael. But this wasn't God's plan. When Abram was 99 years old, God appeared to him again and changed his name to Abraham, meaning 'father of many nations.' God also changed Sarai's name to Sarah and promised that she would have a son within a year."

      type: "question",
      domain: "expression",
      question: "In your mind, what is Abraham's reaction when God tells him Sarah will have a baby?",
      options: [
        "Abraham becomes angry and walks away from God",
        "Abraham laughs in disbelief because they are so old",
        "Abraham looks confused but doesn't say anything",
        "Abraham immediately builds a crib for the baby"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Genesis 17:17 tells us Abraham fell facedown and laughed, saying to himself, 'Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old?' Visualizing his surprised, doubtful reaction helps create a realistic human response to news that seemed impossible."

    {
      type: "story",
      text: "One day, three visitors came to Abraham's tent. Abraham welcomed them with a meal. One of the visitors, who was actually God appearing as a man, told Abraham again that Sarah would have a son. Sarah, who was listening from inside the tent, laughed to herself because she was 90 years old. The visitor asked, 'Why did Sarah laugh? Is anything too hard for the Lord?'"

      type: "question",
      domain: "movement",
      question: "How do you picture Abraham welcoming the three visitors?",
      options: [
        "Ignoring them and continuing his work in the fields",
        "Standing at the door with his arms crossed, looking suspicious",
        "Running to meet them, bowing respectfully, and eagerly offering food and water",
        "Hiding inside his tent, peeking out through a small opening"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Genesis describes Abraham running to meet the visitors, bowing to the ground, and hurriedly preparing a meal for them. Visualizing his enthusiastic hospitality helps create a mental picture of the cultural importance of welcoming travelers in Abraham's time."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Just as God promised, Sarah had a baby boy. They named him Isaac, which means 'laughter.' Abraham was 100 years old when Isaac was born! Abraham and Sarah were filled with joy. God kept His promise, even though it seemed impossible. As Isaac grew, God tested Abraham's faith by asking him to sacrifice Isaac. Abraham prepared to obey, trusting God completely, but at the last moment, God stopped him and provided a ram to sacrifice instead."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "expression",
      question: "When you imagine Sarah holding baby Isaac for the first time, what expression is on her face?",
      options: [
        "Anger and frustration at having to care for a baby at her age",
        "Confusion, not understanding where the baby came from",
        "Joy and wonder, with tears of happiness and perhaps gentle laughter",
        "Boredom, as if nothing special had happened"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Sarah had waited decades for this child, and his name means 'laughter.' Visualizing her face showing deep emotional joy helps create a meaningful mental picture of this miraculous moment when God's impossible promise was fulfilled."

      text: "God blessed Abraham greatly. He lived to be 175 years old and had many descendants. Through his grandson Jacob (later renamed Israel), Abraham became the father of the Israelite nation. God's promise that Abraham would be a blessing to all people came true many generations later when Jesus was born as a descendant of Abraham. Through Jesus, God's blessing would extend to people from every nation, just as He had promised Abraham so long ago.",
      moral: "God keeps His promises, even when they seem impossible, and He rewards those who trust and obey Him."
