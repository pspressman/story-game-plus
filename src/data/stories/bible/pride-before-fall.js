      text: "Marcus loved to climb trees and was very good at it. 'I'm the best climber ever! I don't even need to look where I put my feet,' he boasted to his friends."

      type: "question",
      domain: "where",
      question: "When you picture Marcus in the tree, where would his eyes be looking as he brags to his friends?",
      options: [
        "Down at his feet and the branches",
        "At his friends on the ground below",
        "Up at the sky through the leaves",
        "At the tree trunk for safety"
      ],

    {
      type: "story",
      text: "As Marcus kept bragging and waving his arms, he didn't notice the branch under his foot was cracking. Suddenly, CRACK! Down he tumbled into a pile of soft leaves."

    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "movement",
      question: "Picture what happens to someone's balance when they're waving their arms and not watching their feet. How would their body move?",
      options: [
        "They would become more stable",
        "They would stay perfectly still",
        "They would float upward",
        "They would start to wobble and sway"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: "Being too proud makes us careless, like Marcus not watching where he stepped!"
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Marcus learned something important that day. King Solomon wrote in Proverbs: 'Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.' Being too proud makes us stop being careful."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "what",
      question: "Visualize Sarah showing off her math skills by doing problems in her head without writing anything down. What would likely happen when the problems get harder?",
      options: [
        "She would solve them even faster",
        "She would never make any mistakes",
        "She would start making errors without noticing",
        "The problems would become easier"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Just like Marcus in the tree, being too proud to use helpful tools (like writing) can lead to mistakes."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Now Marcus climbs carefully, always watching his steps. He's still a great climber, but he's learned that being proud and being careful can't happen at the same time."

    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "perspective",
      question: "Picture two climbers: one looking carefully at each branch, another looking away to show off. From a bird's view above, which climber would you trust to reach the top safely?",
      options: [
        "The show-off climber",
        "Neither climber",
        "The careful climber",
        "Both equally"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Being humble and careful helps us succeed, while too much pride leads to falling - just like the proverb teaches!"
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      moral: "Pride goes before a fall means: when we think we're too good to be careful, that's when we make mistakes. Stay humble and pay attention!"
