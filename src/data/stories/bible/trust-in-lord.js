      type: "question",
      domain: "where",
      question: "Picture Noah choosing between his own guess about direction and the official trail markers. Where would following only his understanding likely lead?",

        "Lost in the wrong direction",
        "Immediately home"

      text: "Soon they were lost. Dad pulled out a compass and map. 'Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding,' he said. 'Sometimes we need guidance beyond what we think we know.'"

        "Only the treetops",
        "The whole path and where it leads"

      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: "Like God's wisdom compared to ours - a higher view sees what we cannot!"
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Following the compass instead of their guesses, they found the right path. Noah learned that trusting something wiser than himself - like the compass, or God's word - kept them from danger."

      domain: "perspective",
      question: "Picture a maze from two views: standing inside it versus looking down from above. From which perspective could you better guide someone through it?",
      options: [
        "From inside the maze",

        "Both views are equal",
        "Neither view helps"
