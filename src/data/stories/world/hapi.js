      type: "story",
      text: "In ancient Egypt, there lived a powerful but kind pharaoh. The Nile River would flood each year, bringing rich soil for growing food. One year, the Nile did not flood. The crops could not grow, and the people worried about having enough food. 'What shall we do?' the people asked. The pharaoh called upon the wisest priest in the kingdom, who could speak with the gods."

      type: "question",
      domain: "environment",
      question: "In your mind, what does the land look like when the Nile doesn't flood?",
      options: [
        "Covered in water with fish swimming everywhere",
        "Green and lush with many plants growing",
        "Dry and cracked, with dusty brown earth",
        "Snowy and icy with frozen puddles"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Since the story mentions the Nile not flooding and crops not growing, visualizing dry, cracked earth creates an accurate mental picture of a drought in Egypt."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "expression",
      question: "How do you picture the faces of the Egyptian people when they worry about not having food?",
      options: [
        "Smiling and laughing, not concerned at all",
        "Angry and fighting with each other over the remaining food",
        "Worried with furrowed brows, thin faces, and anxious eyes",
        "Sleeping peacefully without any concern"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The story mentions people were worried about having enough food. Visualizing faces showing concern and anxiety creates a realistic mental picture of how people would look during a time when their food supply is threatened."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "The wise priest told the pharaoh, 'The god of the Nile, Hapi, is unhappy because people have forgotten to be thankful for the river's gifts.' The pharaoh announced that a great celebration would be held to honor Hapi. The people created beautiful music, danced, and offered their finest treasures to the god of the Nile. They built small boats with lanterns and set them afloat on the river at night."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "what",
      question: "How do you picture the wise priest who speaks to the pharaoh?",
      options: [
        "A very young boy wearing modern clothes",
        "An elderly person with ceremonial robes and a shaved head",
        "A soldier wearing armor and carrying weapons",
        "A farmer covered in mud from working in the fields"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "In ancient Egypt, priests were often older people who held respected positions. Visualizing the wise priest with traditional ceremonial robes and a shaved head (as was common for Egyptian priests) creates a historically accurate mental picture."

    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "environment",
      question: "How do you picture the celebration for Hapi at night?",
      options: [
        "People sleeping quietly in their beds",
        "Tiny boats with glowing lights floating on the dark river while people sing on the shore",
        "People arguing and fighting with each other",
        "A single person whispering quietly to the river"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The story describes people creating 'small boats with lanterns' set afloat on the river at night, along with music, dance, and offerings. Visualizing this nighttime scene with glowing boats creates a vivid mental picture of the celebration."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "As the celebration reached its peak, the pharaoh himself waded into the Nile. 'Great Hapi,' he said, 'we are grateful for all you give us. Please accept our thanks and help us once more.' That night, clouds gathered in the sky. By morning, rain began to fall in the distant mountains where the Nile began. Soon after, the river began to rise, and the people rejoiced."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "movement",
      question: "When you imagine the pharaoh wading into the Nile, what do you see?",
      options: [
        "The pharaoh jumping in and swimming underwater",
        "The pharaoh running away from the river in fear",
        "The pharaoh wearing his royal clothes and crown, stepping carefully into the water",
        "The pharaoh turning into a crocodile as he touches the water"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Imagining the pharaoh still in his royal attire, carefully stepping into the water creates a powerful mental image of this important moment. The contrast between royal dignity and the humble act of entering the river makes the scene memorable."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "movement",
      question: "How do you picture the Nile River beginning to rise after the rain?",
      options: [
        "Suddenly exploding into a giant tidal wave that crashes over the land",
        "Staying exactly the same with no visible change at all",

        "Turning bright pink and bubbling like a hot spring"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The story mentions the river 'began to rise' after rain fell in distant mountains. Visualizing a gradual, natural rise in water level helps create a realistic mental picture of how rivers flood after rainfall in their headwaters."

    {
      type: "story",
      text: "The wise priest taught the people how to build better canals to direct the water to more fields. He showed them how to store grain from good years to use during difficult times. The pharaoh ordered that a portion of each harvest should be set aside in great storehouses. 'This way,' he said, 'we will always be prepared, even when Hapi's gifts are less plentiful.'"
    },

      type: "question",
      domain: "what",
      question: "In your mind, what do the Egyptian storehouses for grain look like?",
      options: [
        "Small baskets that hold only a few handfuls of grain",
        "Large stone buildings with many rooms filled with grain sacks",
        "Underwater caves where fish guard the grain",
        "Tiny holes in the ground where ants help store the grain"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Since the pharaoh ordered grain to be stored from each harvest, imagining large stone buildings with multiple storage rooms creates a realistic mental picture of ancient Egyptian granaries that could hold enough food to feed people during difficult years."

        "Plastic water slides like at a water park"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Ancient Egyptians were skilled engineers who built irrigation systems. Visualizing carefully constructed channels with control mechanisms helps create an accurate mental picture of how they would have directed water from the Nile to their fields."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "The pharaoh made a new law: 'Each year when the Nile floods, we will celebrate and give thanks.' This festival, called the 'Wepet Renpet,' became one of the most important celebrations in ancient Egypt. The people never again forgot to be thankful for the Nile's gifts. Through both wisdom and gratitude, the pharaoh had saved his people. And when he eventually joined the gods in the afterlife, the people remembered him as one of Egypt's greatest rulers.",
      moral: "Always be grateful for the gifts that sustain life, and wisdom teaches us to prepare for difficult times during times of plenty."
