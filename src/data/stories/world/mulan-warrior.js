      type: "story",

      options: [
        "Inside her bedroom",
        "In a modern indoor facility",
        "In the courtyard or garden of her family home",
        "At a public sports center"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "In ancient China, a family home would typically have a courtyard or garden area where someone like Mulan could practice archery, not in indoor bedrooms or modern facilities that didn't exist then."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "One day, the Emperor issued a decree that one man from each family must join the army to defend China from invaders. Since Mulan had no brothers and her father was too old, he would have to go to war despite his age and poor health."

    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "what",
      question: "What would the Emperor's decree most likely look like?",
      options: [
        "A printed newspaper announcement",
        "A text message on a phone",
        "A scroll with official seals and calligraphy",
        "A verbal announcement only, with no written form"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "In ancient China, official decrees from the Emperor would be written on scrolls with official seals and calligraphy, not using modern technology like newspapers or phones that didn't exist then."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "That night, Mulan made a brave decision. While her parents were sleeping, she cut her long hair short with her father's sword. She put on her father's armor, took his weapon, and rode away on his horse to join the army in his place, disguised as a young man."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "mood",
      question: "What expression would be on Mulan's face as she cut her hair?",
      options: [
        "Joyful and excited",
        "Determined but nervous",
        "Angry and resentful",
        "Confused and uncertain"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Given the gravity of her decision to cut her hair (a significant act in ancient China) and impersonate a male soldier, Mulan would most logically appear determined about her choice but also nervous about the consequences and dangers ahead."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "For many months, Mulan trained and fought alongside male soldiers without anyone discovering her secret. She was brave in battle and clever in strategy, earning the respect of her fellow warriors and commanders."

        "She would avoid certain movements and be careful with personal activities",
        "She would constantly dance and spin to distract others"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "To maintain her disguise, Mulan would logically need to be careful about certain movements and activities (like bathing or changing clothes), modifying her behavior to avoid discovery, not with exaggerated movements or distractions."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "The army faced many dangerous battles against the invaders. During one critical battle, Mulan came up with a clever plan that saved many lives and led to a decisive victory for the Chinese forces."

      domain: "background",
      question: "What would the battlefield environment most likely look like?",

        "A tropical jungle with dense vegetation"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Historical battles in ancient China typically took place in natural settings like plains or mountain passes, which would be the most logical visualization for this scene rather than cities, beaches, or jungles."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "After years of fighting, the war was finally won. The Emperor himself honored the bravest soldiers, including Mulan. When offered a high position in the court, Mulan politely declined, saying she only wished to return home to her family."

        "Green camouflage like a military uniform"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "In ancient China, the Emperor traditionally wore yellow or gold robes with dragon motifs, as this color was reserved exclusively for the Emperor and symbolized power and prosperity."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "On her return journey, Mulan changed back into women's clothes. When she arrived home and greeted her fellow soldiers who had come to visit, they were shocked to discover that their brave comrade had been a woman all along."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "number",
      question: "How many fellow soldiers would most likely have come to visit Mulan at home?",
      options: [

        "The entire army of hundreds of soldiers"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "It would be most logical to visualize a small group of 2-5 soldier comrades who had bonded with Mulan visiting her home, not the entire army or no one at all."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Mulan's family welcomed her home with joy and pride. Her bravery brought honor to her family, and stories of the woman warrior spread throughout China. Mulan became a symbol of courage, loyalty, and determination for generations to come."
