      text: "Long ago in ancient Mesopotamia, there lived a powerful king named Gilgamesh. He ruled the city of Uruk and had built tall, strong walls around it. Gilgamesh was part god and part human, which made him stronger than any ordinary person. However, he wasn't always kind to his people. He made them work too hard and didn't listen to their problems."

      ],

      question: "How do you picture King Gilgamesh in your mind?",

        "A tall, muscular man with royal clothing and a confident stance",

        "An elderly man with a long white beard using a walking stick"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Since Gilgamesh is described as 'part god and part human' and 'stronger than any ordinary person,' visualizing him as tall and muscular with royal attire helps create a mental picture that matches his character in the story."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "The people of Uruk asked the gods for help with their difficult king. The gods created a wild man named Enkidu who lived in the forest with the animals. The gods thought Enkidu could become Gilgamesh's friend and teach him to be kinder. Enkidu was as strong as Gilgamesh but lived freely in nature, drinking water from streams alongside the gazelles and other wild creatures."

        "As a tiny person the size of a mouse hiding under leaves"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Since Enkidu is described as a 'wild man' who lives with animals in the forest, imagining him with a natural, untamed appearance helps create a clear mental picture that contrasts with the civilized king Gilgamesh."

      question: "How do you imagine Enkidu moving through the forest?",

      type: "story",
      text: "When Enkidu and Gilgamesh finally met, they had a great wrestling match. The ground shook as they fought! Neither could easily defeat the other. After their long struggle, instead of being angry, they became friends. Gilgamesh had never met anyone as strong as himself before. Having a true friend changed Gilgamesh, and he began to care more about others."

    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Gilgamesh and Enkidu decided to go on an adventure together. They traveled to a great cedar forest to cut down trees for their city. But the forest was protected by a fearsome monster named Humbaba. 'No one should enter my forest!' roared Humbaba. But the two friends faced the monster together. With their combined strength and cleverness, they defeated Humbaba."

        "A jungle with vines and colorful flowers everywhere"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Cedar forests in ancient Mesopotamian stories were portrayed as mysterious and impressive. Imagining tall, ancient trees creating a dense, somewhat dark forest helps create an appropriate mental picture for this legendary setting."

      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Since Humbaba is described as a 'fearsome monster' who guards the entire forest and roars at intruders, visualizing a large, frightening creature helps create a mental picture that matches the challenging opponent Gilgamesh and Enkidu face."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "After their victory, they returned to Uruk as heroes. But the goddess Ishtar became angry with Gilgamesh, and as punishment, the gods made Enkidu very sick. Despite all of Gilgamesh's power, he couldn't save his friend. Enkidu died, and Gilgamesh was overcome with sadness. For the first time, he understood what it meant to lose someone he loved."

        "Happy but pretending to be sad in front of other people"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The story tells us Gilgamesh was 'overcome with sadness' after losing his friend. Imagining physical signs of grief creates a mental picture that reflects the emotional impact this loss had on him."

      type: "story",
      text: "Gilgamesh was so afraid of death that he decided to search for the secret of eternal life. He journeyed to find Utnapishtim, the only human who had been given immortality by the gods.

        "Dark waters that seem endless, with thick mist and strange shadows",
        "A bright pink ocean made of sweet-smelling perfume"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Since this is called an 'ocean of death' that 'no ordinary person could survive,' visualizing it as dark, misty, and ominous helps create a mental picture that matches the dangerous and supernatural nature of this part of Gilgamesh's journey."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "When Gilgamesh finally reached Utnapishtim, he learned an important lesson. Utnapishtim said, 'All humans must someday die. Instead of searching for eternal life, you should live a good life and be remembered for your good deeds.' Gilgamesh realized he had been searching for the wrong thing. He returned to Uruk with new wisdom."

    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Gilgamesh returned to his city a changed king. He no longer feared death but instead focused on living well. He became a just and kind ruler who cared for his people. He wrote down his adventures and wisdom on clay tablets. Even though Gilgamesh eventually died like all humans do, his story lived on for thousands of years. Even today, we still remember Gilgamesh and the lessons he learned.",
