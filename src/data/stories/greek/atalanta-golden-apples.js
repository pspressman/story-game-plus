      question: "When you picture someone who can 'outrun horses,' how fast would Atalanta's legs be moving?",
      options: [
        "Slowly like a turtle",
        "Normal walking speed",
        "So fast they'd be a blur",
        "Not moving at all"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "To outrun horses, Atalanta's legs would need to move so incredibly fast they would appear as a blur."

      type: "story",
      text: "To avoid marriage, Atalanta made a deal with her father. 'I will only marry a man who can beat me in a race,' she said. 'But anyone who loses must forfeit their life.' She knew no one could run faster than her."

      domain: "perspective",
      question: "In your mental image, when young men heard they would die if they lost the race, how would most react?",
      options: [
        "Eagerly line up to race",
        "Laugh at the silly rule",
        "Run toward her immediately",
        "Decide not to try"

      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: "Most young men would decide not to try when they heard losing meant death - the risk was too great."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Many brave but foolish young men tried to race Atalanta. She always gave them a head start, then easily caught up and passed them. She ran like the wind itself, her feet barely touching the ground."

    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "touch",
      question: "When you visualize someone running so fast their 'feet barely touch the ground,' what would their footsteps feel like?",
      options: [
        "Heavy thuds shaking the earth",

        "Sticky like walking in mud",
        "Silent with no feeling"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Running so fast that feet barely touch the ground would create light, quick taps rather than heavy footfalls."

      type: "story",
      text: "A young man named Hippomenes fell in love with Atalanta the moment he saw her. But he was not a fast runner. He prayed to Aphrodite, the goddess of love, for help. 'Please, help me win Atalanta's heart!'"

      type: "question",
      domain: "what",
      question: "In your mental image of Hippomenes, knowing he's NOT a fast runner but wants to race Atalanta, what quality would he need most?",

        "Stronger muscles",
        "Longer legs",
        "A clever plan",
        "Better shoes"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Since Hippomenes wasn't fast enough to win by running, he would need a clever plan to have any chance of winning."

      type: "story",
      text: "Aphrodite gave Hippomenes three golden apples from the garden of the Hesperides. 'These apples are irresistible,' she said. 'Use them wisely during the race.' The apples gleamed like small suns in his hands."

        "Dark purple",
        "Transparent like glass"

      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Apples that gleam like small suns would have a shining, bright surface like polished golden metal."

    {
      type: "story",
      text: "The race began. Hippomenes ran as fast as he could, but Atalanta quickly caught up. Just as she was about to pass him, he threw one golden apple to the side of the path. It rolled away, sparkling in the sunlight."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "where",
      question: "In your mental image of the race, where would Hippomenes throw the apple to best distract Atalanta?",

        "Straight ahead on the path",
        "Behind them",
        "To the side of the racing path",
        "High up in the air"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The story says he threw it to the side of the path, making Atalanta leave the race route to get it."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "The golden apple was so beautiful that Atalanta couldn't resist. She turned aside to pick it up, giving Hippomenes time to get ahead. But she was so fast that she quickly caught up again, holding the precious apple."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "number",
      question: "When you visualize the race continuing, how many more golden apples would Hippomenes have left to use?",

        "Zero - he used them all",
        "One more apple",
        "Two more apples",
        "Ten more apples"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Aphrodite gave him three apples total, and he just used one, so he would have two more apples left."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Twice more, just as Atalanta was about to pass, Hippomenes threw a golden apple. Each time, she couldn't resist stopping to pick it up. The third apple he threw near the finish line, and while Atalanta grabbed it, Hippomenes crossed first!"

    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "size",
      question: "In your mental image of Atalanta at the end, holding three golden apples while running, how would this affect her speed?",
      options: [
        "Make her much faster",
        "No effect at all",
        "Slow her down slightly",
        "Make her unable to move"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Carrying three golden apples while running would slow her down slightly due to the extra weight and awkwardness."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Atalanta had lost her first race! But as she looked at clever Hippomenes, who had used his mind instead of his muscles, she smiled. Perhaps marriage to someone so clever wouldn't be so bad. They were married and lived happily, both running together through the forests.",
      moral: "Sometimes cleverness can overcome pure strength or speed. The golden apples remind us that distraction and strategy can be more powerful than direct competition."
