      text: "Long ago in ancient Greece, there lived a kind young woman named Dana√´ and her son, Perseus. They lived in a small village by the sea. Perseus grew up to be brave and strong. The king of their land, who was not a good man, wanted to get rid of Perseus. The king knew of a dangerous monster called Medusa who had snakes for hair. Anyone who looked directly at Medusa would turn to stone!"

      type: "question",
      domain: "what",
      question: "In your mind, what do you see when you imagine Perseus?",
      options: [
        "A young boy with a wooden sword hiding behind his mother",
        "A strong young man standing tall with determined eyes",
        "An old man with a long white beard",
        "A tiny baby wrapped in blankets"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The story describes Perseus as brave and strong, so picturing him as a confident young man fits best with how the story presents him."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "The king sent Perseus on a dangerous quest to bring back the head of Medusa. It seemed impossible! But the gods decided to help Perseus. The goddess Athena gave him a shiny shield. The god Hermes gave him winged sandals to fly through the air. Another god gave him a special bag to safely carry Medusa's head, and a curved sword that could cut through anything."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "what",
      question: "When you imagine the shield Athena gave Perseus, what do you see?",
      options: [
        "A wooden shield with many dents and scratches",
        "A shield made of leaves tied together",
        "A shiny metal shield that reflects like a mirror",
        "A tiny shield that only covers his hand"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The story mentions a 'shiny shield' from Athena. Imagining it as reflective is important because Perseus will use it to see Medusa without looking at her directly."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Perseus flew over land and sea until he found Medusa's cave. He remembered Athena's advice: 'Never look directly at Medusa, or you'll turn to stone.' Instead, Perseus used his shiny shield as a mirror. He could see Medusa's reflection in the shield without looking at her directly. Carefully, Perseus entered the dark cave."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "movement",
      question: "In your mind, how does Perseus move through the cave?",
      options: [
        "He walks straight ahead looking directly forward",
        "He walks backward the entire time",
        "He moves sideways with his shield held up, looking at its reflection",
        "He closes his eyes and feels his way through the dark"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Perseus needs to see where he's going but can't look directly at Medusa. Using his shield as a mirror allows him to move forward while only looking at reflections."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Inside the cave, Perseus found Medusa sleeping. The snakes on her head moved even while she slept. Using his shield to see her reflection, Perseus carefully approached. With one quick swing of his curved sword, Perseus cut off Medusa's head. Quickly, he placed the head in his special bag without looking at it."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "movement",
      question: "When you picture the snakes on Medusa's head, how do they move?",
      options: [
        "They all sway in the same direction like in a wind",
        "They lie completely still and look like hair braids",
        "Each snake moves in different directions, hissing quietly",
        "They stand straight up and shoot fire from their mouths"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The story says the snakes moved even while Medusa slept. Imagining each snake moving independently in different directions creates the most realistic mental picture of this mythical creature."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "With Medusa defeated, Perseus flew back home using his winged sandals. On his journey, he saw a beautiful woman named Andromeda chained to a rock by the sea. Her parents had to sacrifice her to a sea monster because of a curse. Perseus decided to save her."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "environment",
      question: "In your mind, what does the sea near Andromeda look like?",
      options: [
        "Completely calm with small gentle waves",
        "Rough with dark waters and large waves crashing against the rocks",
        "Frozen solid with ice everywhere",
        "Bright pink with rainbow fish jumping everywhere"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Since Andromeda is about to be sacrificed to a sea monster, imagining a threatening sea with dark, rough waters creates a mental picture that matches the dangerous situation."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Just as the sea monster approached to eat Andromeda, Perseus swooped down from the sky. He took Medusa's head from his bag and held it up, being careful to look away himself. The moment the sea monster saw Medusa's face, it turned to stone! Perseus freed Andromeda, and they returned to her kingdom together."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "movement",
      question: "How do you imagine the sea monster turning to stone?",
      options: [
        "It happens all at once, like a statue suddenly replacing the monster",
        "The monster explodes into dust and disappears",
        "The change starts at its eyes and slowly spreads through its body",
        "Nothing happens because the monster closed its eyes"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Imagining the stone transformation starting at the eyes (where the monster saw Medusa) and spreading through its body creates a vivid mental picture of the magical transformation process."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Perseus and Andromeda fell in love and decided to get married. They traveled to Perseus's homeland together. When they arrived, they found that the evil king was still causing problems. Perseus confronted the king and his supporters. During their meeting, Perseus revealed Medusa's head one last time. The king and all his evil supporters instantly turned to stone. Perseus became the new king, and he ruled justly with Queen Andromeda by his side. Together they lived happily for many years.",
      moral: "Courage, cleverness, and doing what is right will help you overcome even the most difficult challenges."
