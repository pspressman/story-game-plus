      question: "When you picture someone who 'loves to talk' and tells stories for hours, how would the air around Echo usually sound?",
      options: [
        "Completely silent",
        "Filled with her constant chatter",
        "Only bird songs",
        "Deep rumbling noises"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Someone who loves to talk and tells stories for hours would fill the air with constant chatter and conversation."

    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Hera was furious when she discovered Echo's trick. 'You love to have the last word?' Hera said angrily. 'Then that's all you'll ever have!' She cursed Echo to only repeat the last words that others said. Echo could never speak her own thoughts again."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "what",
      question: "In your mental image, after Hera's curse, what would happen when someone said 'Hello there' to Echo?",
      options: [
        "Echo would say 'Goodbye'",
        "Echo would say nothing",
        "Echo would say 'Hello there' in full",
        "Echo would only say 'there'"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: "The curse made Echo only repeat the last words spoken, so she would only say 'there' - the final word."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Poor Echo wandered the mountains, unable to start conversations or express her feelings. One day, she saw a handsome young man named Narcissus hunting deer. He was the most beautiful person she had ever seen, and she fell in love instantly."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "movement",
      question: "When you visualize Echo following Narcissus through the forest but unable to speak first, how would she likely move?",
      options: [
        "Loudly stomping to get attention",
        "Running directly at him",
        "Quietly hiding behind trees",
        "Flying above the forest"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Unable to speak first and probably shy about her curse, Echo would quietly hide behind trees while following him."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Narcissus got separated from his hunting friends. 'Is anyone here?' he called out. 'Here!' Echo replied joyfully, only able to repeat his last word. 'Come to me!' Narcissus shouted. 'To me!' Echo answered, stepping out from behind the trees with open arms."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "perspective",
      question: "In your mental image, when Echo steps out with open arms after only saying 'To me!', what would Narcissus think she meant?",
      options: [
        "She was threatening him",
        "She was calling him to come to her",
        "She was doing exercises",
        "She was measuring the trees"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "By repeating 'To me!' with open arms, it would seem like Echo was calling Narcissus to come to her, not responding to his call."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Narcissus was proud and cruel. He had rejected everyone who ever loved him. 'Get away from me!' he said harshly. 'I would rather die than let you love me!' Echo could only repeat sadly, 'Love me... love me...' Her heart broke, and she ran away to hide in caves."
    },

      domain: "where",
      question: "When you picture a heartbroken Echo hiding from the world, where in the mountains would she most likely go?",

        "To sunny meadows",
        "To the highest peaks",
        "To crowded villages",
        "Deep into dark caves"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: "The story tells us the heartbroken Echo ran away to hide in caves, dark places where she could be alone."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Echo was so sad that she stopped eating and faded away until only her voice remained. Even today, when you shout in the mountains or caves, you can hear Echo repeating your last words back to you."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "sound",
      question: "In your mental image, if you shouted 'Hello beautiful day!' in a canyon where Echo's voice remains, what would you hear back?",
      options: [
        "The entire phrase repeated",
        "Just 'Hello'",
        "Just 'day' echoing back",
        "Complete silence"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Since Echo can only repeat the last words spoken, you would hear just 'day' echoing back."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "The gods decided to punish Narcissus for his cruelty to Echo and others. One day, he knelt by a clear pool to drink. In the still water, he saw his own reflection for the first time - and fell deeply in love with it."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "what",
      question: "When you visualize Narcissus seeing his reflection in still water, what would he think he was looking at?",

        "Another real person in the water",
        "His own reflection",
        "A painting",
        "A fish"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: "Narcissus had never seen his reflection clearly before, so he would think he was looking at another real person in the water."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Narcissus reached toward the beautiful face in the water, but every time he touched the surface, the image broke into ripples and disappeared. He couldn't eat or sleep, staring at his reflection and slowly wasting away just as Echo had done."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "movement",
      question: "In your mental image, when Narcissus touches the water to reach the face, what happens to the reflection?",
      options: [
        "It becomes clearer",
        "It breaks apart into ripples",
        "It reaches back to touch him",
        "It turns into a fish"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "When you touch still water, it creates ripples that break apart any reflection on the surface."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Eventually, Narcissus realized the truth - he had fallen in love with himself. But it was too late. He died by the pool, and in his place grew a flower that bends over the water as if looking at its own reflection. We call this flower the narcissus.",
      moral: "Too much pride and too little kindness bring their own punishment. Echo lost her voice for talking too much, while Narcissus lost his life for loving only himself."
