      type: "story",
      text: "Long ago in ancient Greece, there was a king named Minos who ruled the island of Crete. He had ordered the inventor Daedalus to build a vast maze called the Labyrinth, and inside this maze lived a terrible monster‚Äîthe Minotaur, half-man and half-bull."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "shape",
      question: "What shape would the Labyrinth most likely be when viewed from above?",
      options: [
        "A perfect circle with a single spiral path",
        "A square grid with straight paths",
        "An irregular pattern with twisting, confusing passages",
        "A triangle with three distinct sections"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The Labyrinth was designed to be confusing and impossible to navigate, so it would most logically be visualized as an irregular pattern with twisting passages rather than a simple geometric shape."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Every nine years, Athens had to send seven young men and seven young women to Crete as a tribute. These youths were thrown into the Labyrinth to be devoured by the Minotaur. When the time for the third tribute came, Theseus, the son of King Aegeus of Athens, volunteered to go, determined to slay the beast."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "size",
      question: "How big was the Minotaur compared to Theseus?",
      options: [
        "Smaller than Theseus, about the size of a child",
        "About the same size as Theseus",
        "Larger than Theseus, about the size of a large man",
        "Towering over Theseus, much taller and broader"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: "Since the Minotaur was described as fearsome with the body of a man and head of a bull, it would logically be depicted as much larger than a regular human like Theseus, towering over him to emphasize its monstrous nature."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "When Theseus arrived in Crete, King Minos's daughter, Ariadne, fell in love with him. She decided to help him defeat the Minotaur by giving him a ball of thread, so he could find his way back out of the Labyrinth."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "color",
      question: "What color would Ariadne's thread most likely be?",
      options: [
        "Clear or white, like regular thread",
        "Golden or bright yellow, to be visible in the dark labyrinth",
        "Green or brown, to blend with the surroundings",
        "Black, to match the darkness"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The thread would need to be clearly visible to Theseus in the dark labyrinth, so a bright color like gold or yellow would be most useful and logical to visualize."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Theseus entered the Labyrinth, unwinding the thread as he went. He wandered through the dark, winding passages until he found the Minotaur sleeping in the center of the maze. Theseus fought with the Minotaur and, after a tremendous struggle, defeated the monster."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "background",
      question: "What would the walls of the Labyrinth most likely look like?",
      options: [
        "Made of wooden planks with gaps between them",
        "Smooth white marble with polished surfaces",
        "Rough stone walls with torches spaced along them",
        "Made of tall hedges like a garden maze"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Since the Labyrinth was built in ancient Crete, it would most likely have rough stone walls with occasional torches to provide minimal lighting, fitting the architectural capabilities and materials of the time."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Following the thread back through the twisting passages, Theseus found his way out of the Labyrinth. He escaped with Ariadne and the other Athenians on their ship, sailing away from Crete before King Minos discovered what had happened."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "movement",
      question: "How would the ship be moving as they escaped from Crete?",
      options: [
        "Drifting slowly and silently, trying not to be noticed",
        "Moving steadily with both sail and oars at full power",
        "Zigzagging unpredictably to avoid pursuit",
        "Barely moving, struggling against the waves"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "To escape quickly before King Minos discovered them, the ship would logically be moving at maximum speed with both sail and oars being used to achieve the fastest possible departure."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Theseus returned to Athens as a hero, having freed his city from the terrible tribute to King Minos. The legend of his bravery and cunning in defeating the Minotaur lived on for generations."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      moral: "Courage, cleverness, and a helping hand can overcome even the most daunting challenges."
