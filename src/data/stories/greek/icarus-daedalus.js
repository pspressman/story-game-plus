    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Long ago in ancient Greece, there lived a great inventor named Daedalus. He and his young son Icarus had been imprisoned by King Minos in a tall tower on the island of Crete. The king had ordered this punishment because Daedalus had helped the hero Theseus escape from the Labyrinth."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "what",
      question: "What would the tower where Daedalus and Icarus were imprisoned most likely look like?",
      options: [
        "A modern skyscraper with glass windows",
        "A stone tower with small windows and thick walls",
        "A wooden hut with a straw roof",
        "An underground dungeon with no windows"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "In ancient Greece, a prison tower would most logically be visualized as made of stone with thick walls and small windows to prevent escape, not as a modern skyscraper, wooden hut, or underground structure."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Daedalus knew they could not escape by land or sea, as King Minos controlled all routes from the island. After much thought, Daedalus came up with a brilliant plan. He began collecting feathers from birds that flew past their tower window. Over many months, he created two pairs of wings using wax to hold the feathers together."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "color",
      question: "What color would the completed wings most likely be?",
      options: [
        "Bright rainbow colors",
        "Solid metallic gold",
        "Varying shades of brown, white, and gray like bird feathers",
        "Transparent and clear like glass"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Since the wings were made from actual bird feathers, they would most naturally be visualized in the colors of real feathers - varying shades of brown, white, and gray - not as rainbow, gold, or transparent materials."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Before they took flight, Daedalus warned his son: \"Fly at a middle height, Icarus. If you fly too low, the sea's dampness will clog your wings. If you fly too high, the sun's heat will melt the wax. Keep to the middle way.\""
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Father and son put on their wings and soared into the sky, free at last. The fishermen and shepherds below looked up in amazement, thinking they were gods. Daedalus looked back to check on Icarus as they flew away from Crete."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "background",
      question: "What would you see in the background as Daedalus and Icarus flew away from Crete?",
      options: [
        "Modern city skyline with tall buildings",
        "Dense jungle with tropical trees",
        "Blue sea, rocky coastline, and small white buildings",
        "Snow-covered mountains and pine forests"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Since Crete is a Mediterranean island, the most appropriate visualization would include the blue sea, rocky coastline, and small white buildings typical of Greek islands, not modern cities, jungles, or snowy landscapes."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Exhilarated by the feeling of flight, Icarus grew bolder. Forgetting his father's warning, he flew higher and higher, soaring toward the sun. The hot sun began to melt the wax that held his wings together. Soon, feathers were falling away from the wings."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "mood",
      question: "What expression would be on Icarus's face as he flew higher toward the sun?",
      options: [
        "Fear and worry",
        "Sadness and regret",
        "Joy and excitement",
        "Anger and frustration"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The story describes Icarus as 'exhilarated' and 'bolder', indicating he would most likely appear joyful and excited as he soared higher, not afraid, sad, or angry."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      text: "Too late, Icarus realized his mistake. His wings fell apart, and he plunged down into the sea below. Daedalus, hearing his son's cry, turned around only to see ripples on the water's surface where Icarus had fallen. Heartbroken, Daedalus continued his flight alone to Sicily, where he built a temple to Apollo and hung up his wings, never to fly again."
    },
    {
      type: "question",
      domain: "movement",
      question: "How would Icarus most likely be moving as he fell from the sky?",
      options: [
        "Floating gently like a leaf",
        "Spinning and tumbling with arms outstretched",
        "Swimming through the air with calm strokes",
        "Rising upward against gravity"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Without functioning wings, a person falling from the sky would most naturally be visualized as spinning and tumbling with arms outstretched, not floating gently, swimming, or rising upward."
    },
    {
      type: "story",
      moral: "Balance is essential in life. Pride and overconfidence can lead to downfall, while heeding wise advice brings safety."
